Modelling the use of Drones to charge Electric vehicles (EVs).

  Basically vehicles drive until they need a charge - currently triggered by thresholds in the EV model. (Can be configured in additional files)
  they then get charged by the nearest drone, that is not busy, after which the drone will return to the nearest charge hub - or another vehicle if required
  
Charging stations(need to be created on the road network and are 'discovered' in the code. These are used to launch and 'charge' drones
The SUMO default for these is that the charging power is 0 - so they won't charge vehicles even if the vehicles stop at the station.

This code uses the nearest free drone, or if none free, then one will be spawned (upto a limit) from the nearest charging station.
When charging is complete/the drone is out of charge then the drone goes to the nearest chargeing station to recharge.

The parameters used for the Drone in this model correspond to those of an Ehang 184 which has top speed of 60km/h, and a 14.4 KW battery giving 23 mins flight time.
Specific parameters for the default drone and other drones can be set in additional files.
The order of allocation of drones to vehicles is dependant on the 'urgency' (wu parameter) the ratio between the distance to the nearest charge point and the remaining charge
  and proximity (we parameter) the vehicle that is closest to the most other vehicles also needing a charge. 
  
In the GUI, vehicles and drones turn red when they need charging and green when they are actually charging.

There are python and c++ variants of the code. The python version can use either sumo or sumo-gui, the c++ variant can only use sumo because sumolib doesn't currently support sumo-gio

Execution:
   open a cmd/shell window in the directory where these files have been placed
     python drclass.py -h      summarises the runstring parameters and defaults
     sumodrone -h
     
   demonstration files : (running from the directory where these files were unpacked.)
      python  drclass.py  demo/demo.sumocfg                   Note that the first drone is launched around 1200s

Drone State model:
        PARKED                  Drone is parked at a charging hub, topping up batteries and available for allocation
        FLYINGTORENDEZVOUS*     Drone is flying to a computed rendezvous point for a specific EV
        FLYINGTOEV*             Drone is flying to an EV - either directly or after reaching the rendezvous point
        CHARGINGEV*             Drone is coupled to the EV and charging the EV
        FLYINGTOPARK            Drone is flying back to nearest Hub - is available for allocation
        FLYINGTOCHARGE          Drone is flying back to the hub, needing a charge of either the flying or EV charging battery
        CHARGINGDRONE           Drone is at a charging hub, charging to levels viable for allocation - cannot be allocated in this state
        NULL                    Drone is parked at a charging hub with full charges
            * states are managed by the EV, other states managed by the ControlCentre
                State changes can be triggered by the Drone battery levels running too low and the allocated EV leaving the simulation
                rendezvous states may be skipped using the -l (line of sight) parameter
        
EV State model:
        DRIVING                 EV is driving round the network - does not require a charge
        CHARGEREQUESTED         EV has requested a charge via the control centre
        WAITINGFORRENDEZVOUS    EV has been allocated a drone by the Control centre and is travelling to the computed rendezvous point
        WAITINGFORDRONE         Drone has reached the rendezvous point, EV is still driving, Drone is chasing to couple for charging     
        CHARGINGFROMDRONE       EV is charging from the Drone
        LEFTSIMULATION          EV has left the simulation
        NULL                    EV has left the simulation and told any Drone that it has left
                State changes are triggered by monitoring the EVs via traci,
                   by the Control Centre allocating a drone and by the drone breaking off to charge itself
        

At the end of the Simulation,  summary statistics are provided - as below, these are condensed into a single line if the -b (brief) option is used.
